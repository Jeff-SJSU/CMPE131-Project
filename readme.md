# Introduction
 website will allow the user to access a web store with a personalized account.
The format of the site will follow a basic web store, where the user must log in to their
own account in order to access the various functions of the site.

# Instructions
After downloading the package from github, use pip to install flask and flask_sqlalchemy with the follow commands in terminal:
 - pip install flask
 - pip install flask_sqlalchemy
- Run the main.py file in the package
- Copy and paste the web address from the terminal to a web browser

# Web Navigation
Once the account is created, a confirmation message should appear (not implemented yet). The user will be automatically logged in upon creating the
account for the first time. Currently, the default redirection will be back to the home page. The user can go to their account profile to change their
profile pictures or any of their account information. 

The webstore portion of the site should be accessible regardless of login status.
