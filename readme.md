# Introduction
The website will allow the user to access a web store with a personalized account.
The format of the site follows a basic web store, where the user must log in to their own account in order to access certain functions of the site, but anyone can browse.

# Instructions
After downloading the package from github, use pip to install dependencies with the follow commands in terminal:
 - `pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-login flask-wtf pillow`
- Run `py main.py` in the root folder
- Copy and paste the web address from the terminal to a web browser

# Web Navigation
The user can go to their account profile to change their profile pictures or any of their account information by changing their name or email or uploading a new picture. The user also has the ability to delete their account, which will remove them, their products, lists, and reviews from the system.

The webstore portion of the site is accessible to logged out users. The home page currently shows all seller items that are available for purchase.

The user can then click on an item to see more information. The user can then add the item to their checkout cart or to a list, such as their Wishlist. If they are not logged in before adding an item, the system will prompt the user to login, or register if they do not have an account. 

Users can leave reviews for products. Products and sellers will show an average of all reviews they've received.

Users can mark their account as a seller account and then upload items to the store. They can edit the items to add a temporary discount or change details about the items.
